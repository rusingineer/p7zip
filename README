	p7zip 0.81
	==========

Homepage : http://sourceforge.net/projects/p7zip/

p7zip is a port of the Windows program 7za.exe.

7za.exe is a file archiver with the highest compression ratio.
Homepage : www.7-zip.org


INSTALL:
	make clean
	make

  this procedure has been tested on :
	Redhat 9.0 Standart (x86)
	Fedora 2 (Redhat) (x86)
	Mandrake 10.0 Official (x86)
	Debian 3.0 Stable (x86)
	CYGWIN_NT-5.1 1.5.9(0.112/4/2) 2004-03-18 23:05 i686 Cygwin

	For Mandrake, you must change "-O2" to "-g2" in the makefile
	(buggy compiler ?)


USAGE:

  7z t archive.7z  : tests files in the archive archive.7z
  7z l archive.7z  : lists all files from archive archive.7z
  7z x archive.7z  : extracts all files from archive archive.7z
                   to the current directory

  7z a archive.7z file1 fileN : add files to the archive archive.7z

  7z a -r archive.7z  "dir1/*" :  add all files from directory "dir1" to
                                  archive archive.7z (the "" is needed)

  Remarks : "" is needed if you use "*" or "?"
            (p7zip use the Windows logic of 7za.exe)

  NEW since version 0.81 :
  7z a -r archive.7z  dir1 :  add all files from directory "dir1" to
                              archive archive.7z

  You can also add or extract files to/from .zip or .tar archives.
  You can also compress/uncompress .gz or .bz2 files.

  7z a -tzip   archive.zip file1
  7z a -ttar   archive.tar file1
  7z a -tgzip  file.gz     file
  7z a -tbzip2 archive.bz2 file

  You can use password for archives:
  7z a -r -pmy_password archive.7z  "dir1/*" 

  For more, see the documentation of 7za.exe in html directory
  (chapter "User's Guide for command line version").

LIMITATIONS:

  - 7z can handle properly UNICODE filenames only if the environment is UTF-8.
  Example : export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
  Remark  : see in the directory "/usr/lib/locale" the possible values
            for LANG
 
  - 7z (and p7zip) does not support uid/gid or Unix file access permissions
  for the .tar format (so, use tar on Unix)

  - p7zip ignores Windows file access permissions (files are created with
    default permissions)

  - p7zip archives the file/directory instead of the link.

  - p7zip can extract files from a SFX archive (Windows program that is
  auto extractible), but cannot create SFX archives.

  see also TODO file.

DEVELOPPER CORNER:

  - WaitForMultipleObject has no equivalence on Unix.
  - Events don't exist.
  - sizeof(wchar_t) = 4 with GCC (2 with MS VC++)
  - "FIXME" in source code indicates that you should add codes
    to better handle all cases.

  - "FIXED" in source code indicates that the original code has been
    changed to work in unix environment.

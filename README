	p7zip 0.91
	==========

Homepage : http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/

p7zip is a port of the Windows programs 7z.exe and 7za.exe provide by 7-zip.

7-zip is a file archiver with the highest compression ratio.
Homepage : www.7-zip.org

7z.exe uses plugins to handle archives.
7za.exe is a stand-alone executable.
7za.exe handles less archive formats than 7z.exe.

BUILD :
-------

  If you have downloaded the "bin" package,
	use directly the program bin/7za.
	(tested on Redhat 9.0, Fedora 2, Mandrake 10.0,
	Debian 3.0)
	As the program is statically linked, its should
	run on many x86 linux.

  If you have downloaded the "source" package,
	According to your OS, copy makefile.linux,
	makefile.freebsd or makefile.cygwin over makefile.machine

	make clean : to clean all directories
	make       : to build bin/7za, bin/7z and its plugins.

  this procedure has been tested on :
	Linux - Redhat 9.0 Standart (x86)
	Linux - Fedora 2 (Redhat) (x86)
	Linux - Mandrake 10.0 Official (x86)
	Linux - Debian 3.0 Stable (x86)
	FreeBSD 5.2.1 (x86)
	CYGWIN_NT-5.1 1.5.9(0.112/4/2) 2004-03-18 23:05 i686 Cygwin

INSTALL :
---------

  - 7za is a stand-alone program, you can put this program where you want.
  example :  cp bin/7za /usr/local/bin/7za

  - 7z needs its plugins. You must copy the file 7z and the two directories
  Formats and Codecs in the same destination directory.
  You can make link to 7z.
  example :
  mkdir -p /usr/local/share/7z  /usr/local/bin
  cp -r bin/7z bin/Formats bin/Codecs /usr/local/share/7z/
  ln -s /usr/local/share/7z/7z /usr/local/bin/7z


USAGE:
------
  Remark : you can replace 7z with 7za.

  7z t archive.7z  : tests files in the archive archive.7z
  7z l archive.7z  : lists all files from archive archive.7z
  7z x archive.7z  : extracts all files from archive archive.7z
                   to the current directory

  7z a archive.7z file1 fileN : add files to the archive archive.7z

  7z a -r archive.7z  "dir1/*" :  add all files from directory "dir1" to
                                  archive archive.7z (the "" is needed)

  Remarks : "" is needed if you use "*" or "?"
            (p7zip use the Windows logic of 7za.exe)

  NEW since version 0.81 :
  7z a -r archive.7z  dir1 :  add all files from directory "dir1" to
                              archive archive.7z

  You can also add or extract files to/from .zip or .tar archives.
  You can also compress/uncompress .gz or .bz2 files.

  7z a -tzip   archive.zip file1
  7z a -ttar   archive.tar file1
  7z a -tgzip  file.gz     file
  7z a -tbzip2 archive.bz2 file

  You can use password for archives:
  7z a -r -pmy_password archive.7z  "dir1/*" 

  For more, see the documentation of 7za.exe in html directory
  (chapter "User's Guide for command line version").
  7z a -t7z  -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on -r archive.7z  dir1 :
      adds all files from directory "dir1" to archive archive.7z
      using "ultra settings".
      -t7z     : 7z archive
      -m0=lzma : lzma method
      -mx=9    : level of compression = 9 (Ultra)
      -mfb=64  : number of fast bytes for LZMA = 64
      -md=32m  : dictionary size = 32 megabytes
      -ms=on   : solid archive = on
      -r       : enable recurse subdirectories

LIMITATIONS from 7-zip :
------------------------
  - works only on little-endian machine

  - does not support uid/gid or Unix file access permissions
  for the .tar format (so, use tar on Unix)

  - the flag "-mt=on" is not understood.

  - can't use absolute paths (wait for 7-zip 4.0)

LIMITATIONS for Unix version only :
-----------------------------------

  - can handle properly UNICODE filenames only if the environment is UTF-8.
  Example : export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
  Remark  : see in the directory "/usr/lib/locale" the possible values
            for LANG
 
  - ignores Windows file access permissions (files are created with
    default permissions)

  - archives the file/directory instead of the link.

  - can extract files from a SFX archive (Self Extracting Archive)
  but cannot create SFX archives.

  - cannot test or extract file from rar archives because the source code
  that handles rar archives is not provide by 7-zip.
  (but you can list rar archives)

  see also TODO file.

DEVELOPPER CORNER:
------------------

  - WaitForMultipleObject has no equivalence on Unix.
  - Events don't exist.
  - sizeof(wchar_t) = 4 with GCC (2 with MS VC++)
  - "FIXME" in source code indicates that you should add codes
    to better handle all cases.

  - "FIXED" in source code indicates that the original code has been
    changed to work in unix environment.

	p7zip 4.10
	==========

Homepage : http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/

p7zip is a port of the Windows programs 7za.exe provide by 7-zip.

7-zip is a file archiver with the highest compression ratio.
Homepage : www.7-zip.org

7za.exe is a stand-alone executable.

BUILD :
-------

  If you have downloaded the "bin" package,
	use directly the program bin/7za.
	(tested on Redhat 9.0, Fedora 2, Mandrake 10.0,
	Debian 3.0)
	As the program is statically linked, its should
	run on many x86 linux.

  If you have downloaded the "source" package,
	According to your OS, copy makefile.linux,
	makefile.freebsd, makefile.cygwin, ...
        over makefile.machine

	make clean : to clean all directories
	make       : to build bin/7za

  this procedure has been tested on :
	Linux - Redhat 9.0 Standart (x86)
	Linux - Fedora 2 (Redhat) (x86) (gcc 3.3.3 and gcc-3.4.1 with 
                stack-smashing protector from www.trl.ibm.com/projects/security/ssp/)
	Linux - Mandrake 10.0 Official (x86)
	Linux - Debian 3.0 Stable (x86)
	FreeBSD 5.2.1 (x86) (gcc 3.3.3)
	CYGWIN_NT-5.1 1.5.9(0.112/4/2) 2004-03-18 23:05 i686 Cygwin

	Linux - Debian 3.0 (alpha) with gcc 2.95.4

	Linux - SuSE 8 ES (AMD64 Opteron) with gcc 3.2.2
            (use "-m32" flags to avoid bugs ...)

	Solaris 8 (sparc) with gcc 2.95.2
	Solaris 9 (sparc) with gcc 3.3.2

INSTALL :
---------

  - 7za is a stand-alone program, you can put this program where you want.
  example :  cp bin/7za /usr/local/bin/7za

USAGE:
------
  7za t archive.7z  : tests files in the archive archive.7z
  7za l archive.7z  : lists all files from archive archive.7z
  7za x archive.7z  : extracts all files from archive archive.7z
                   to the current directory

  7za a archive.7z file1 fileN : add files to the archive archive.7z

  7za a archive.7z  dir1 :  add all files from directory "dir1" to archive archive.7z 

  You can also add or extract files to/from .zip or .tar archives.
  You can also compress/uncompress .gz or .bz2 files.

  7za a -tzip   archive.zip file1
  7za a -ttar   archive.tar file1
  7za a -tgzip  file.gz     file
  7za a -tbzip2 archive.bz2 file

  You can use password for archives:
  7za a -pmy_password archive.7z  dir1

  For more, see the documentation of 7za.exe in html directory
  7za a -t7z  -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on archive.7z  dir1 :
      adds all files from directory "dir1" to archive archive.7z
      using "ultra settings".
      -t7z     : 7z archive
      -m0=lzma : lzma method
      -mx=9    : level of compression = 9 (Ultra)
      -mfb=64  : number of fast bytes for LZMA = 64
      -md=32m  : dictionary size = 32 megabytes
      -ms=on   : solid archive = on

LIMITATIONS from 7-zip :
------------------------

  - does not support uid/gid or Unix file access permissions
  for the .tar format (so, use tar on Unix)

  - can't use absolute paths (wait for 7-zip 4.0)

LIMITATIONS for Unix version only :
-----------------------------------

  - can handle properly UNICODE filenames only if the environment is UTF-8.
  Example : export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
  Remark  : see in the directory "/usr/lib/locale" the possible values
            for LANG
 
  - ignores Windows file access permissions (files are created with
    default permissions)

  - archives the file/directory instead of the link.

  - can extract files from a SFX archive (Self Extracting Archive)
  but cannot create SFX archives.

  see also TODO file.

DEVELOPPER CORNER:
------------------

  - WaitForMultipleObject has no equivalence on Unix.
  - Events don't exist.
  - sizeof(wchar_t) = 4 with GCC (2 with MS VC++)
  - "FIXME" in source code indicates that you should add codes
    to better handle all cases.

  - "FIXED" in source code indicates that the original code has been
    changed to work in unix environment.

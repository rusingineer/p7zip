- try to fix p7zip when compiled with "gcc -m64" on Linux 64bits with AMD64.

- use valgrind to detect errors in the program.

- use a more thread-friendly "WaitForMultipleObjects"
  (see myEvents.cpp)

- if an error occurs during the execution of 7z, some temporary files are left
  ( ex : 7zi12495.tmp )

- suppress all exit(EXIT_FAILURE), FIXME, ...

- no chmod/chown(uid,gid) for TAR

- no support for linked files (the file or directory behind the link
  is archived ...)

- clean the headers file in include_windows

- Use a more portable "String.h" (suppress the need of wine_strings.cpp)

- creation of SFX archives ?

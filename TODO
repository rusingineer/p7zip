- port plugins from 7-zip to p7zip (ex : paqar)

- rewrite RAR plugin (because 7-zip does not provide source
  code for this plugin)

- use valgrind to detect errors in the program.

- use a more thread-friendly "WaitForMultipleObjects"
  (see myEvents.cpp)

- if an error occurs during the execution of 7z, some temporary files are left
  ( ex : 7zi12495.tmp )

- suppress all DEBUG, exit(EXIT_FAILURE), FIXME, ...

- no chmod/chown(uid,gid) for TAR

- no support for linked files (the file or directory behind the link
  is archived ...)

- clean the headers file in include_windows

- TESTS with ISO-LATIN1 characters in filename (ιθΰηκω ...)
  OK  : 7zip
  BAD : zip, tar

- Use a more portable "String.h" (suppress the need of wine_strings.c)

- TESTS on a Big Endian Machine (Solaris Sparc, Linux PPC ?)

- creation of SFX archives ?

- creation of SFX archives
  Only SFX archives with "*.exe" filenames are valid. 

- use valgrind to detect errors in the program.

- use a more thread-friendly "WaitForMultipleObjects" (see myEvents.cpp)

- if an error occurs during the execution of 7z, some temporary files are left
  ( ex : 7zi12495.tmp )

- suppress all exit(EXIT_FAILURE), FIXME, ...

- no chmod/chown(uid,gid) for TAR

- no real support for linked files (the file or directory behind the link is archived ...)

- Use a more portable "String.h" (suppress the need of wine_strings.cpp)

- UTF16 : try to test with Complex Unicode filenames

- KNOWN BUGS

  - date
  7za l archive.7z  (7za l archive.tar)
  and 7za x archive.7z and then "ls -l"
  => not the same date

  - absolute path ?

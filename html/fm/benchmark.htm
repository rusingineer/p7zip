<H1>Benchmark</H1>

<P>In that box you can measure value of the 
performance of your computer.</P>

<P>There are two tests:<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Compressing with LZMA method
  <LI>Decompressing with LZMA method
</OL>

<P>Benchmark shows rating in MIPS (million instructions per second).
Rating value is calculated from measured speed and it
is normalized with AMD Athlon XP CPU. So if you have Athlon XP, 
rating values must be close to real CPU frequency.</P>

<P>Compressing speed and rating strongly depend from memory (RAM) latency.
Also you can change dictionary size to increase memory usage.
If you enable Multi-threading option, 7-Zip will use two 
threads for compressing. It can speed up compressing speed up to 
70-80% on Multi-Processor systems or up to 25% on Pentium 4 
with Hyper-Threading. Decompressing program always uses one thread, 
so Multi-threading option doesn't affect decompressing speed and rating.</P>

<P>Decompressing speed and rating strongly depend from integer part of CPU.
For example, Intel Pentium 4 has big branch 
misprediction penalty (which is effect of long pipeline) and pretty slow 
multiply and shift operations. So Pentium 4 has pretty low decompressing 
ratings.</P>

<P>Total rating is average of the compressing and decompression ratings.</P>

<P>Also the program checks possible errors. So if Errors field shows more than 0 
errors, it means that your hardware is bad. In most cases it means that 
your RAM is working with errors. In that case please don't use 7-Zip for 
compressing data, since such errors can lead to data losses.</P>

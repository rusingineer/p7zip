Version 4.16
============

  - From Windows version of 7-zip 4.16 :
    - Speed optimization (5%) for 7z / LZMA 
    - 7za now supports .Z archives
    - -r- switch in command line now is default for all commands 
    - Some bugs were fixed

  - From Windows version of 7-zip 4.15 :
    - Z format supporting (extracting only)
    - 7-Zip now can extract ZIP archives compressed with "Shrink" method

  - man pages added (thanks to Mohammed Adnene Trojette)
  - bug #1112167 fixed (Temporary directory must be on same partition as target)
    p7zip failed moving the temporary file at the end of
    compressing to target file if the directories don't reside
    on the same partition (or network path).
  - bug #1164659 fixed (Invalid file date for "big endian" machine)
  - p7zip now uses ".so" instead of ".dll"
  - p7zip now handles "ctrl-c" and "kill" to cleanup temporary files before exiting
  - p7zip now runs on BeOS.
  - better support of filenames with spaces.
  - some code cleanup
    - "myWindows/myFiles.cpp" is now in "Windows/FileIO.cpp"
    - "myWindows/myFindFile.cpp" is now in "Windows/FileFind.cpp"
    - "myWindows/myDirectoryAndPath.cpp" is now in "Windows/FileDir.cpp"
    - "myWindows/myEvents.cpp" is now in "Windows/Synchronization.cpp"
    - "myWindows/wine_strings.cpp" is now in "Windows/String.cpp"
  

Version 4.14.01
===============
  - huge speed up for multi CPUs machines (Thanks to loderunner - http://sourceforge.net/users/loderunner/).
  - some code cleanup
  - Fix problems with link files or directories.
  - "7z a dummy -tgzip -so Doc.txt > archive.gz" now works.
  - in the messages, the path separator is now '/' instead of '\'.

Version 4.14
============

  - From Windows version of 7-zip 4.14 :
    - STL using was reduced
    - 7za now supports Split(001) archives
    - "7za | more" now works
    - Bugs item #1093095 : Usage banner now says "7za" (instead of "7z") when the binary is "7za"

  - use of AString instead of std::string (no more need of #include <string>")
  - makefile.linux_gcc_2.95_no_need_for_libstdc added to build 7za for the
    p7zip*_bin.tar.bz2 package.
    7za provided by p7zip*_bin.tar.bz2 is build on Debian 3.0 with gcc 2.95.4
    and should now find the locale on all kinds of Linux (Debian, Fedora, Mandrake, ...).

Version 4.13
============
  - new port of 7za from the source of 7za 4.13Beta for Windows

  - From Windows version of 7-zip 4.13 :
    - Switch "--" stops switches parsing
    - Some bugs were fixed
    - User's manual updated (DOCS/MANUAL/index.htm)

  - makefile.netbsd_x86 added [Bug #1069055].

  - new method to install 7z and its plugins (the "link" method do no work)

  - installer added (install.sh).

  - makefile.macosx_with_fink becomes makefile.macosx
    and makefile.macosx uses c++ instead of CC
    (on some MacOSX, CC is a link to gcc instead of g++)

  - new flag "-utf16" to enable "utf16" conversion [Bug #1075229].

  - new logic to automatically enable or disable "utf16" conversion :
    no locale, locale=="C" or locale=="POSIX" implies utf16=off
    else  utf16=on
    uses "-utf16" or "-no-utf16" to change this behaviour.
    [Bug #1075229]

  - 7z (compiled with -O2) works now on Sparc Solaris. 

Version 4.12
============
  - new port of 7za from the source of 7za 4.12Beta for Windows

  - From Windows version of 7-zip 4.11 and 4.12 :
    - 7-Zip now supports Zip64 extension of ZIP format. So now it's 
      possible to compress files bigger than 4 GB to ZIP archives.
    - Some bugs were fixed

  - fix "7za a archive.7z file" that added all the files and directories
    with filename "file", "FILE", "File" ...

  - p7zip now displays the locale (ex : en_US.UTF-8) in the banner.

  - new flag "-no-utf16" to avoid lossly conversion in filenames.
    CAUTION : use this flag when you do not plan to export your archive.

  - support creation of self extracting archive.

  - better support of symbolic link (now, an invalid symbolic link
    do not stop archiving but displays a warning).

  - better support of files that the user cannot read.
    (now this kind of file is not added to the archive, and p7zip displays a warning).

  - return of 7z and its plugins.

  - support of listing/testing/extracting files from a splitted archive (only with 7z).

  - support of MacOX X 10.X.

  - creation of Gzip/Tar archives didn't work on Linux Alpha.

  - see "contrib/VirtualFileSystemForMidnightCommander/readme" to use 7za with "mc".

Version 4.10
============
  - new port of 7za from the source of 7za 4.10Beta for Windows
    => p7zip now work on big endian CPU.

  - 7z for Unix is not maintain anymore (because as the source of unrar plugin for 7z
    is not available, 7z is unless on Unix).

Version 0.91
============
  - add support for FreeBSD 5.2.1
    In Windows/Time.h add "#include <time.h>"
    and prototype change for FileTimeToUnixTime()

  - bug 990684 Corrected : support of filesystem
    that support case sensitive filenames.
    Example, since version 0.91 : 
    "7z a glibc -r glibc-2.3.2"
    does not terminate with error :
      Duplicate filename:
      glibc-2.3.2\sysdeps\m88k\m88100\add_n.S
      glibc-2.3.2\sysdeps\m88k\m88100\add_n.s 

Version 0.90
============
  - build of 7z.exe and its DLL.
  7z.exe support more archive formats than 7za.exe
  thanks to DLL in Formats and Codecs directories
  - "#pragma once" is now in comments
  - mainly For OpenBSD :
    - add #include <wchar.h> in include_windows/winnt.h
    - remove stuff for GUID_SECTION and GUID_SECT in include_windows/basetyps.h
      and include_windows/initguid.h
    - some changes in 7zip/Crypto/aesopt.h because of endian.h

Version 0.81
============
  - add a copy of the help of 7-zip (see html directory)
  - "7z a -r tmp.7z directory" works as expected.
    no more need for commands like : 7z a -r tmp.7z "directory/*"
  - 7z restores the date of each files (but not directories)
  - 7z supports UNICODE filenames (version 0.80 supports only ASCII/Latin1 filenames)
  - support of gcc 2.95

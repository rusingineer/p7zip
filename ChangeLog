Version 0.91
============
  - add support for FreeBSD 5.2.1
    In Windows/Time.h add "#include <time.h>"
    and prototype change for FileTimeToUnixTime()

  - bug 990684 Corrected : support of filesystem
    that support case sensitive filenames.
    Example, since version 0.91 : 
    "7z a glibc -r glibc-2.3.2"
    does not terminate with error :
      Duplicate filename:
      glibc-2.3.2\sysdeps\m88k\m88100\add_n.S
      glibc-2.3.2\sysdeps\m88k\m88100\add_n.s 

Version 0.90
============
  - build of 7z.exe and its DLL.
  7z.exe support more archive formats than 7za.exe
  thanks to DLL in Formats and Codecs directories
  - "#pragma once" is now in comments
  - mainly For OpenBSD :
    - add #include <wchar.h> in include_windows/winnt.h
    - remove stuff for GUID_SECTION and GUID_SECT in include_windows/basetyps.h
      and include_windows/initguid.h
    - some changes in 7zip/Crypto/aesopt.h because of endian.h

Version 0.81
============
  - add a copy of the help of 7-zip (see html directory)
  - "7z a -r tmp.7z directory" works as expected.
    no more need for commands like : 7z a -r tmp.7z "directory/*"
  - 7z restores the date of each files (but not directories)
  - 7z supports UNICODE filenames (version 0.80 supports only ASCII/Latin1 filenames)
  - support of gcc 2.95
  - support of gcc 3.4
  - 7z needs no more libgen.h (dirname() and basename())
  - less "Internal Error #7" during arguments parsing
  - minor change in class CThread

============
  - First public release
  - support of gcc 3.2 and 3.3
